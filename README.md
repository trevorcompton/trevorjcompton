### Hey there!

This is my project folder for Wandr, a test app that pulls in reulsts from Spotify imbed code share and the Google Maps API to give you a customized musical experience depending on your geographic location.

### What is wandr?

Wandr is a geo-musical app that allows the user to select their location on the map (for now the only valid locations are California, New York State, and Tennessee) and gives the user a song corresponding to the selected state.

### Dependencies

Wandr uses the Google Maps API and utilizes the share code function of Spotify to pull songs for the app.
